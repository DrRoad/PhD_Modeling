# PhD_Modeling
Repository for hold all models for PhD work torwards a hybrid Dynamic User Assignment (DUA) based traffic simulator (SUMO), with Python3 code to run in parallel to model deterioration based on roadway properties and simulated use. This Python3 code also defines an Owner Agent that is tasked with maintaining the roadways under varring degrees of constraints. Budgetary and equipment are currently the expressed constraints. Other constraints that should be included are labor, material, seasonal, and many more. However, budgetary and equipment is an ok place to start. 
  [  ] Constraints Needing Immedate expressions: Equipment deterioration(time, use, efficency(slow speed in the field or slower recovery time after use and allowed to be put back into resource pool)  

TO DO (Many things not included):
  Capture code that runs reliably for a full time period.
  Develop Python Code or VBA Excel to generate 1 year of of Calibration Files (365). Basing off of DVRPC traffic count data and varing it in realtionship to the desired simulation's day_of_the_week(month(weather(season))). Total days needed = 1825 days, but only have to generate 365 at a time.
